## Core Components

### 1. StatementStitcher (core.py)

The `StatementStitcher` class is the heart of the stitching system, responsible for combining multiple financial statements into a unified view.

#### Key Features:
- **Concept Standardization**: Uses `ConceptMapper` to normalize financial concepts across different filings
- **Period Management**: Handles different period types (instant vs duration) and fiscal periods
- **Data Integration**: Merges statement data while preserving hierarchical relationships
- **Flexible Period Views**: Supports multiple period selection strategies via `PeriodType` enum

#### Implementation Details:

```python
class StatementStitcher:
    class PeriodType(str, Enum):
        RECENT_PERIODS = "Most Recent Periods"
        RECENT_YEARS = "Recent Years"
        THREE_YEAR_COMPARISON = "Three-Year Comparison"
        # ... additional period types
```

The stitcher follows a multi-step process:

1. **Period Extraction**: Extracts and deduplicates periods from all statements
2. **Period Selection**: Applies period type logic to select relevant periods
3. **Data Standardization**: Normalizes concepts using the concept mapper
4. **Data Integration**: Merges data from multiple statements into unified structure
5. **Output Formatting**: Applies intelligent ordering using the ordering system

#### Key Methods:
- `stitch_statements()`: Main orchestration method
- `_extract_periods()`: Period discovery and deduplication
- `_select_periods()`: Period filtering based on strategy
- `_integrate_statement_data()`: Data merging logic
- `_format_output_with_ordering()`: Final formatting with ordering

### 2. Statement Ordering System (ordering.py)

The ordering system provides intelligent, consistent ordering of financial statement items across multiple periods using a three-tier strategy:

#### Architecture:
1. **Template-Based Ordering**: Uses canonical XBRL concept templates
2. **Reference-Based Ordering**: Extracts ordering from best available statement
3. **Semantic Positioning**: Infers positions based on financial semantics

#### Key Classes:

**FinancialStatementTemplates**:
- Maintains canonical ordering templates for different statement types
- Maps XBRL concepts to standardized positions
- Handles concept normalization and matching

**StatementOrderingManager**:
- Orchestrates the three-tier ordering strategy
- Manages concept positioning and conflict resolution
- Ensures template section integrity

#### Template Structure:
Templates are organized by financial statement sections with base positions:

```python
INCOME_STATEMENT_TEMPLATE = [
    (0, "revenue_section", ["us-gaap:Revenue", "us-gaap:SalesRevenueNet", ...]),
    (100, "cost_section", ["us-gaap:CostOfRevenue", "us-gaap:CostOfGoodsSold", ...]),
    (200, "gross_profit", ["us-gaap:GrossProfit"]),
    # ... additional sections
]
```

### 3. Period Optimization (periods.py) - **REFACTORED**

The period optimization system has been completely refactored from a monolithic function into a clean, class-based architecture for better maintainability, testability, and extensibility.

#### New Architecture:

**PeriodOptimizer**: Main orchestrator class that coordinates the entire period selection process

**Core Components**:
- **PeriodSelectionConfig**: Configuration dataclass for all period selection behavior
- **PeriodMatcher**: Handles exact period matching logic (eliminates approximate matching)
- **FiscalPeriodClassifier**: Classifies periods based on fiscal information and duration
- **StatementTypeSelector**: Handles statement-specific period selection logic
- **PeriodMetadataEnricher**: Adds comprehensive metadata to selected periods
- **PeriodDeduplicator**: Handles deduplication, sorting, and limiting of periods

#### Key Features:
- **Exact Matching Only**: Eliminates all approximate date matching to prevent fiscal year boundary bugs
- **Statement Type Awareness**: Specialized logic for balance sheets vs income/cash flow statements
- **Fiscal Period Intelligence**: Smart classification of annual, quarterly, and YTD periods
- **Configurable Behavior**: All duration ranges and behavior flags are configurable
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful error handling
- **Clean Separation**: Each class has a single responsibility for better maintainability

#### Implementation Process:

The refactored system follows a clean pipeline:

1. **Period Extraction** (`_extract_all_periods`):
   - Iterates through all XBRL objects
   - Extracts entity info and document_period_end_date
   - Delegates to StatementTypeSelector for appropriate period selection

2. **Statement-Specific Selection**:
   - **Balance Sheets**: Uses instant periods with exact date matching
   - **Income/Cash Flow**: Uses duration periods with fiscal period classification
   - **Exact Matching**: Only selects periods that end exactly on document_period_end_date
   - **Fallback Logic**: Conservative fallback only when no document date available

3. **Metadata Enrichment** (`_enrich_with_metadata`):
   - Adds comprehensive metadata including dates, durations, fiscal info
   - Standardizes date formats and calculations

4. **Deduplication and Limiting** (`_deduplicate_and_limit`):
   - Sorts periods chronologically
   - Removes exact duplicates (same date)
   - Limits to maximum number of periods

#### Configuration System:
```python
@dataclass
class PeriodSelectionConfig:
    annual_duration_range: Tuple[int, int] = (350, 380)
    quarterly_duration_range: Tuple[int, int] = (80, 100)
    require_exact_matches: bool = True
    # ... additional configuration options
```

### 4. Virtual Presentation Tree (presentation.py)

The presentation system creates hierarchical structures that preserve financial statement relationships while applying semantic ordering.

#### Key Classes:

**PresentationNode**:
- Represents individual statement items with hierarchy
- Maintains parent-child relationships
- Supports semantic ordering within sibling groups

**VirtualPresentationTree**:
- Builds hierarchical structures from flat concept lists
- Applies semantic ordering while preserving hierarchy
- Prevents cross-section hierarchies that break template groupings

#### Tree Building Process:
1. **Node Creation**: Creates nodes for all concepts with metadata
2. **Hierarchy Building**: Establishes parent-child relationships based on levels
3. **Semantic Ordering**: Applies ordering within sibling groups
4. **Tree Flattening**: Converts back to linear list preserving hierarchy

### 5. Query System (query.py)

The query system provides a powerful interface for exploring stitched financial data.

#### Key Classes:

**StitchedFactsView**:
- Extracts facts from stitched statements rather than raw XBRL
- Provides standardized, post-processed data for querying
- Caches results for performance

**StitchedFactQuery**:
- Extends base `FactQuery` with multi-period capabilities
- Supports standardized concept filtering
- Provides trend analysis functionality

#### Enhanced Query Methods:
- `by_standardized_concept()`: Filter by standardized labels
- `by_original_label()`: Filter by company-specific labels
- `across_periods()`: Find concepts appearing across multiple periods
- `by_fiscal_period()`: Filter by fiscal quarters/years
- `trend_analysis()`: Set up trend analysis queries

### 6. XBRLS Class (xbrls.py)

The `XBRLS` class provides the main user interface for multi-period XBRL analysis.

#### Key Features:
- **Unified Interface**: Single entry point for multi-period analysis
- **Statement Access**: Easy access to stitched statements
- **Query Interface**: Direct access to query functionality
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of stitched results

#### Factory Methods:
- `from_filings()`: Create from Filing objects
- `from_xbrl_objects()`: Create from XBRL objects

#### Main Methods:
- `get_statement()`: Get stitched statement data
- `render_statement()`: Render formatted statement tables
- `to_dataframe()`: Convert to pandas DataFrame
- `query()`: Start new fact queries

## Design Patterns and Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Each module has a clear, focused responsibility:
- Core logic separated from presentation
- Period optimization isolated from stitching
- Query functionality independent of core stitching

### 2. Strategy Pattern
The ordering system uses multiple strategies (template, reference, semantic) that can be combined and prioritized.

### 3. Factory Pattern
XBRLS class provides factory methods for different creation scenarios.

### 4. Caching Strategy
Multiple levels of caching improve performance:
- Statement-level caching in XBRLS
- Facts caching in StitchedFactsView
- Template position caching in ordering system

### 5. Template Method Pattern
The stitching process follows a consistent template with customizable steps.

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Period Deduplication Algorithm
```python
def _extract_periods(self, statements):
    # Extract all periods with end dates
    # Sort by date (newest first)
    # Deduplicate periods with same end date
    # Return ordered list of unique periods
```

### 2. Concept Matching Algorithm
```python
def _concepts_match(self, concept1, concept2):
    # Normalize both concepts
    # Handle namespace variations
    # Compare normalized forms
    # Return boolean match result
```

### 3. Hierarchical Ordering Algorithm
```python
def _build_hierarchy(self, original_order):
    # Maintain parent stack based on levels
    # Check semantic compatibility
    # Prevent cross-section hierarchies
    # Build parent-child relationships
```
