GitHub Issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} - {ISSUE_TITLE}

Filing Access Issue Template
===========================

Use this template for issues involving:
- Filing download failures
- Attachment access problems
- Authentication/authorization issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Rate limiting or throttling issues

Template Usage:
1. Replace {ISSUE_NUMBER} with actual GitHub issue number
2. Replace {ISSUE_TITLE} with brief issue description  
3. Replace {COMPANY_TICKER} with affected company ticker
4. Replace {FORM_TYPE} with relevant form (10-K, 10-Q, etc.)
5. Add additional test cases as needed
6. Remove template comments before committing
