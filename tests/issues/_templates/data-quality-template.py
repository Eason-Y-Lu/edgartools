GitHub Issue #{ISSUE_NUMBER} - {ISSUE_TITLE}

Data Quality Issue Template
===========================

Use this template for issues involving:
- Incorrect financial values
- Missing financial data
- Calculation errors in statements
- Data validation failures
- Inconsistent data across periods

Template Usage:
1. Replace {ISSUE_NUMBER} with actual GitHub issue number
2. Replace {ISSUE_TITLE} with brief issue description  
3. Replace {COMPANY_TICKER} with affected company ticker
4. Replace {EXPECTED_VALUE} and {ACTUAL_VALUE} with specific values
5. Add additional test cases as needed
6. Remove template comments before committing
