# Filtering filings

Filings can be filtered in many different ways like by `form`, `date`, `CIK`, `ticker`, and **accession number**.
You also filter while getting filings using the `get_filings` function or after getting filings using the `filter` method.

For the most part these approaches will give identical results, except that with get_filings you are filtering from all available filings in the SEC, while with `filter` you are reducing the nu,ber of filings in a `Filings` object.


## Filtering using parameters of `get_filings`
You can filter using parameters of the `get_filings` function. 

### Get filings by form

To get filings of a specific form type like 10-K, you can use the `form` parameter. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(form='10-K')
```

The `form` can also be a list of forms. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(form=['10-K', '10-Q'])
```

By default the `amendments` parameter is set to `True` so that amended filings are included. You can set it to `False` to exclude amended filings. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(form='10-K', amendments=False)
```


### Filtering by date

You can filter filings by date using the `filing_date` parameter. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(filing_date='2022-01-01')
```

You can also filter by a range of dates. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(filing_date='2022-01-01:2022-01-10')
```

You can filter up to a date. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(filing_date=':2022-01-10')
```

as well as after a date. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings(filing_date='2022-01-10:')
```

#### More filtering examples

```python

from edgar import get_filings

# Get filings for 2021
filings_ = get_filings(2021) 

# Get filings for 2021 Q4
filings_ = get_filings(2021, 4) 

# Get filings for 2021 Q3 and Q4
filings_ = get_filings(2021, [3,4]) 

# Get filings for 2020 and 2021
filings_ = get_filings([2020, 2021]) 

# Get filings for Q4 of 2020 and 2021
filings_ = get_filings([2020, 2021], 4) 

# Get filings between 2010 and 2021 - does not include 2021
filings_ = get_filings(range(2010, 2021)) 

# Get filings for 2021 Q4 for form D
filings_ = get_filings(2021, 4, form="D") 

# Get filings for 2021 Q4 on "2021-10-01"
filings_ = get_filings(2021, 4, filing_date="2021-10-01") 

# Get filings for 2021 Q4 between "2021-10-01" and "2021-10-10"
filings_ = get_filings(2021, 4, filing_date="2021-10-01:2021-10-10") 
                                                                       
```


## Filtering using `Filings.filter`

You can filter filings using the `filter` method after getting filings. This work mostly identically to filtering using `get_filings`.
The difference is that `filter` reduces from an existing `Filings` object rather that the entire SEC.

Example:
```python
filings().filter(form='10-K')
```

```python
    def filter(self, *,
        form: Optional[Union[str, List[IntString]]] = None,
        amendments: bool = None,
        filing_date: Optional[str] = None,
        date: Optional[str] = None,
        cik: Union[IntString, List[IntString]] = None,
        exchange: Union[str, List[str], Exchange, List[Exchange]] = None,
        ticker: Union[str, List[str]] = None,
        accession_number: Union[str, List[str]] = None) -> Optional['Filings']:

        :param form: The form or list of forms to filter by
        :param amendments: Whether to include amendments to the forms e.g. include "10-K/A"
        :param filing_date: The filing date
        :param date: An alias for the filing date
        :param cik: The CIK or list of CIKs to filter by
        :param exchange: The exchange or list of exchanges to filter by
        :param ticker: The ticker or list of tickers to filter by
        :param accession_number: The accession number or list of accession numbers to filter by
```


### Filtering by CIK

You can filter filings by CIK by using the `filter` function with the `cik` parameter to get all filings for a company. For example:
```python 
filings = get_filings.filter(cik='0000320193')
```

### Filtering by ticker

You can filter filings by ticker  by using the `filter` function with the `ticker` parameter. For example:
```python
filings = get_filings.filter(ticker='AAPL')
```
Note that this first does a lookup of the CIK for the ticker and then gets filings for the CIK.
So if you know the CIK, it is better to use that directly.

Note that you can also get use `Company(<ticker>)` OR  `Company(<cik>)` and then use the `get_filings` method to get filings for the company. For example:

### Filtering by exchange

You can filter filings by `exchange`. 

```python
filings = get_filings().filter(exchange='NASDAQ')
```
There are the following exchanges available:

| Exchange |
|----------|
| Nasdaq   | 
| NYSE     | 
| CBOE     | 
| OTC      | 


## Using `head`, `tail`, and `sample`
You can subset filings using the `head` and `tail` and `sample` methods. For example:

```python
filings = get_filings()
filings.head(10)
filings.tail(10)
filings.sample(10)
```
