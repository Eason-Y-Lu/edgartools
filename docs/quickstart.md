# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with EdgarTools in 5 minutes. This guide will take you from installation to your first meaningful analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection
- Basic familiarity with Python

## Step 1: Install EdgarTools

```bash
pip install edgartools
```

## Step 2: Set Your Identity

The SEC requires all API users to identify themselves. Set your identity once:

```python
from edgar import set_identity

# Use your name and email (required by SEC)
set_identity("John Doe john.doe@company.com")
```

**üí° Tip:** You can also set the `EDGAR_IDENTITY` environment variable to avoid doing this in every script.

## Step 3: Your first filings

Let's see available filings on the SEC Edgar

```python
from edgar import *

filings = get_filings()
```

## Step 4: Filtering for insider trading filings

To focus on insider trading activity, filter for Form 4 filings:

```python
insider_filings = filings.filter(form="4")
```

## Step 5: Getting a Company

If you would like to focus on a specific company, you can use the `Company` class. For example, to analyze Apple Inc. (AAPL):

```python
c = Company("AAPL")  # Apple Inc.
```

## Step 6: Getting filings for a Company
You can retrieve all filings for a company using the `company.get_filings` method:

```python
# Get Apple's recent SEC filings
aapl_filings = c.get_filings()
```

## Step 7: Insider Filings for Apple Inc.

To analyze insider trading activity for Apple Inc., filter the filings for Form 4:

```python
insider_filings = c.get_filings(form="4")
# Get the first insider filing
f = insider_filings[0]

# Convert to a Form4 object
form4 = f.obj()
```
